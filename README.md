What
---
Files for parts by maedler that world development used in its designs.



Why
---
The worlddevelopment design strategy as evolving over the course of time requires to be able to reference a part in a certain version.
This allows later remanufacturing and prevents suddenly no longer working designs due to modified parts because new part modifications are changesets in version control and therefore go noticed and can even be ignored if custom manufacturing of parts is possible.
